# Overview

This project diplays "Hello World" when I run the code. I was able to do so by just using the print statement and inserting "Hello World" with the quotes inside the parantheses. The file format should be .py in the foler.

Creating this project demonstrates fundamental concepts such as writing code, compiling or interpreting it, and seeing the result.
